<!-- SUMMARY -->
<section id="summary" class="section">
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project proposes a <strong>modular, low-power communication mesh</strong>
    designed for early-stage and long-term Mars exploration missions. The system
    uses a combination of <strong>1U CubeSat relay nodes</strong> and
    <strong>ground-based emergency stations</strong> to provide resilient,
    self-healing communication between astronauts, rovers, and surface habitats.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike traditional point-to-point or centralized relay systems, this approach
    emphasizes <strong>distributed redundancy</strong>, allowing communication to
    persist even when individual nodes fail. The architecture prioritizes
    <strong>rapid deployment</strong>, <strong>energy efficiency</strong>, and
    <strong>scalability</strong>, making it suitable for harsh, infrastructure-poor
    environments such as Mars.

<!-- PROBLEM -->
<section id="problem" class="section dark">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      Mars terrain creates severe <strong>line-of-sight and signal attenuation</strong>
      challenges due to dust storms, elevation changes, and obstacles.
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      Fixed communication infrastructure is <strong>slow, expensive, and risky</strong>
      to deploy during early missions.
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      Communication failures during emergencies can result in
      <strong>loss of life, mission failure, or stranded crews</strong>.
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      There is currently no lightweight, rapidly deployable solution for
      <strong>inter-settlement connectivity</strong> on Mars.

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<section id="architecture" class="section">
  <h2>System Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The Mars Communication Mesh is composed of three tightly integrated layers:
    orbital relay nodes, a wireless surface mesh, and intelligent ground stations.
    Together, these components form a fault-tolerant network capable of adapting
    to node loss and environmental changes.
  </p>

  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>1U CubeSat Node</h3>
      <p>
        Acts as an orbital or elevated relay node. Each CubeSat carries an
        ESP8266-based controller, Zigbee radio, and attitude control hardware
        for antenna alignment and mesh optimization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Wireless Mesh Layer</h3>
      <p>
        A Zigbee-based mesh network enables multi-hop routing, allowing data to
        dynamically reroute around failed or obstructed nodes without human intervention.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Ground Base Stations</h3>
      <p>
        Fixed or semi-mobile stations that provide emergency beacons, sensor data,
        and communication access points for astronauts and rovers.
      </p>

  <h2>Hardware Design</h2>

  <p>
    The hardware is optimized for <strong>low power consumption</strong>,
    <strong>modularity</strong>, and <strong>manufacturability</strong>.
    Wherever possible, custom PCBs are used to reduce size, mass, and wiring complexity.

  <h2>Impact & Vision</h2>

  <p>
    The Mars Communication Mesh enables <strong>reliable emergency response</strong>,
    <strong>resource coordination</strong>, and continuous connectivity between
    humans and machines. Beyond technical utility, the system supports
    <strong>human morale and safety</strong> by ensuring astronauts are never
    completely isolated.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the long term, this mesh network can serve as a foundational layer for
    Martian settlements, expanding organically as new nodes are deployed,
    ultimately forming a resilient planetary communication backbone.
