<!-- SUMMARY -->
<section id="summary" class="section">
  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project proposes a <strong>modular, low-power communication mesh</strong>
    designed for early-stage and long-term Mars exploration missions. The system
    uses a combination of <strong>1U CubeSat relay nodes</strong> and
    <strong>ground-based emergency stations</strong> to provide resilient,
    self-healing communication between astronauts, rovers, and surface habitats.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike traditional point-to-point or centralized relay systems, this approach
    emphasizes <strong>distributed redundancy</strong>, allowing communication to
    persist even when individual nodes fail. The architecture prioritizes
    <strong>rapid deployment</strong>, <strong>energy efficiency</strong>, and
    <strong>scalability</strong>, making it suitable for harsh, infrastructure-poor
    environments such as Mars.

<!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
<section id="architecture" class="section">
  <h2>System Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The Mars Communication Mesh is composed of three tightly integrated layers:
    orbital relay nodes, a wireless surface mesh, and intelligent ground stations.
    Together, these components form a fault-tolerant network capable of adapting
    to node loss and environmental changes.
  </p>

  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>1U CubeSat Node</h3>
      <p>
        Acts as an orbital or elevated relay node. Each CubeSat carries an
        ESP8266-based controller, Zigbee radio, and attitude control hardware
        for antenna alignment and mesh optimization.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Wireless Mesh Layer</h3>
      <p>
        A Zigbee-based mesh network enables multi-hop routing, allowing data to
        dynamically reroute around failed or obstructed nodes without human intervention.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
      <h3>Ground Base Stations</h3>
      <p>
        Fixed or semi-mobile stations that provide emergency beacons, sensor data,
        and communication access points for astronauts and rovers.

<!-- TELEMETRY -->
<section id="telemetry" class="section">
  <h2>Telemetry & Communication Analysis</h2>

  <p>
    Reliable telemetry is essential for sustaining communication between CubeSat
    relay nodes, surface base stations, and mobile assets. The system utilizes a
    <strong>PCB-integrated microstrip patch antenna</strong> designed to provide
    directional radiation, compact form factor, and efficient power utilization.
  </p>

  <!-- ================================
       PATCH ANTENNA THEORY
       ================================ -->

  <h3>Patch Antenna Design & Theory</h3>

  <p>
    A microstrip patch antenna consists of a conductive radiating patch separated
    from a ground plane by a dielectric substrate. Radiation occurs due to fringing
    electric fields at the patch edges when the antenna resonates at its design
    frequency.
  </p>

  <p>
    This antenna type is well suited for CubeSat applications due to its
    <strong>low profile</strong>, <strong>lightweight structure</strong>, and
    <strong>direct PCB integration</strong>, eliminating the need for external
    antenna assemblies.
  </p>

      communication band, showing radiating patch geometry and ground plane layout.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ================================
       GAIN & DIRECTIVITY
       ================================ -->

  <h3>Gain & Radiation Characteristics</h3>

  <p>
    The patch antenna exhibits a <strong>directional radiation pattern</strong>,
    concentrating transmitted energy normal to the patch surface. This improves
    link efficiency compared to omnidirectional antennas, particularly in
    power-limited space systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Antenna gain is achieved through controlled directivity rather than active
    amplification. The measured gain provides sufficient link margin while
    maintaining compliance with power and size constraints.
  </p>

       LINK BUDGET ANALYSIS
       ================================ -->

  <h3>Link Budget Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    A detailed link budget analysis was performed to ensure reliable communication
    between CubeSat relay nodes and surface base stations under worst-case operating
    conditions. The analysis accounts for transmit power, antenna gains, propagation
    losses, and receiver sensitivity.
  </p>

      Figure 13: Link budget diagram summarizing transmit power, antenna gains,
      free-space path loss, and received signal strength.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The calculated link margin confirms that the system maintains sufficient signal
    strength for reliable data transmission, even with conservative assumptions
    for distance and environmental losses.

<!-- DASHBOARD -->
<section id="dashboard" class="section dark">
  <h2>Local Telemetry & Control Dashboard</h2>

  <p>
    This dashboard provides a real-time mission-control interface for monitoring
    system health, environmental conditions, and CubeSat orientation on Mars.
    The visual design emphasizes high contrast and clarity to support rapid
    decision-making during both nominal operations and emergency events.
  </p>

  <p>
    Telemetry from the ground station and CubeSat nodes is transmitted to a
    locally hosted server using the MQTT protocol. The dashboard subscribes to
    these streams to render orientation data, sensor values, alerts, and
    communication status with minimal latency.
  </p>

      environmental telemetry, system alerts, and communication status.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    A central 3D visualization displays the CubeSat attitude in real time using
    IMU data from the onboard MPU6050. Orientation updates are streamed at
    approximately 20 Hz, enabling smooth visualization of pitch, roll, and yaw.
    The model rotates about its geometric center to maintain a stable reference
    frame.
  </p>

  <p>
    Environmental telemetry from the ground station, including atmospheric
    temperature and solar luminosity, is updated at 1 Hz and displayed as
    time-series plots with fixed axis scaling to preserve contextual accuracy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Persistent alert panels visually latch when abnormal conditions are detected,
    including seismic activity and reduced atmospheric clarity due to dust
    storms. A rolling event log records system messages and emergency signals
    with timestamps, while uplink indicators confirm active communication with
    CubeSat relay nodes.
